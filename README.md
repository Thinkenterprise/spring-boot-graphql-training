The project **Spring Boot GraphQL Training** contains the source code of the exercise tasks from the book [Spring for GraphQL in Practice: Implementation of modern web APIs](https://www.amazon.de/Spring-GraphQL-Practice-Implementation-modern/dp/B0B6XMW5KB/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1GXX0J783C57U&keywords=Spring+for+GraphQL+in+Practice&qid=1658674260&sprefix=spring+for+graphql+in+practice%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-1).

**Java 17 is required to complete the exercise tasks**. Since Spring Boot 2.7, Java 17 has been used. Therefore Spring Boot 2.7 is a prerequisite for using Spring for GraphQL.



Chapters 3-8 are concluded with exercise tasks. The Github project is split into Maven projects with the following naming conventions.

```
c<chapter-number>.spring-boot-graphql-<chapter-name>.<start|final> 
```
 

The ``<start> projects`` can be used as a starting point for the exercise task. Each start project has a ``readme.md`` file in which the solution steps are described. The ``<final>-projects`` contain the sample solution. Bugs or enhancements are welcome via Github issues and pull requests.
